## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The Vechile Weight and All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. These columns did not have a significant impact on mpg.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
If we have our hypothesis as follows:
H0: PH = 0.5 (null hypothesis)
HA: PH â‰  0.5 (alternate hypothesis) 
Since our p-value is 5.35e-11, we reject our null hypothesis making the slope of our linear model not zero.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear model does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.  Within this dataset there are not enough significant variables, meaning that this analysis only works on our current set of data.  Ideally we should have more significant variables, which would prove more effective when analyzing new prototypes.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not? 

As show below in the total summary chart, the average of the three manufacturing lots does meet the requirements for suspension coils.  Individually only Lot 3 does not meet the requirement that the coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.  Lot 1 and 2 have similar results, however Lot 3 has drastically larger numbers and changes the final outcome.

Within the lot summary chart it is clear to see that the variance and standard deviation are significantly higher in manufacturing lot 3.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

First I used a t-test to determine if the average PSI of these manufacturing lots are different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. Since the p-value was 2.2e-16, it can be determined that the two means are statistically not similar therefore we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Using the subset function to only look at the row for Manufacturing Lot 1 to compare against the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The result was a p-value of 1.568e-11, it can be determined that the two means are statistically not similar therefore we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Using the subset function to only look at the row for Manufacturing Lot 2 to compare against the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The result was a p-value of 0.0005911, it can be determined that the two means are statistically not similar therefore we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Using the subset function to only look at the row for Manufacturing Lot 3 to compare against the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The result was a p-value of 0.1589, it can be determined that the two means are statistically not similar therefore we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Study Design: MechaChar vs Competition

### Summary of a statistical study of the MechaCar performing against competition
Currently we can compare the vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, all wheel drive, and mpg against the competition.  In this study the mpg would be broken down into mpg for city and for highway. The remaining metrics can be easily compared to other competitors.  In this analysis I am going to add additional metrics that potential buyers are looking at. 

### What metric or metrics are you going to test?
Additional metrics I will test is the price of the vehicles, the cargo capacity, horsepower, passenger volume, fuel efficiency and turning radius. 

### What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
Null Hypothesis: Since MechaCar's vehicle lengths are significantly smaller than the competitors all the metrics on average for MechaCar will be more favorable.
Alternative Hypothesis: The competitors metrics on average are more favorable regardless of the vehicle length. 

### What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
One statistical test I would use is the Chi-Square test to determine if there is a relationship between the vehicle length and corresponding metrics. I would also run multiple linear regression in order to accurately compare the vehicle length to other variables to minimize regression errors.

### What data is needed to run the statistical test?
The data that is needed to run the statistical test is the vechile length, fuel efficiency, horsepower, and price of the vehicle. Additional information can be gathered for further testing.
